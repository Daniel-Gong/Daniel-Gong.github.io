I am happy to announce that I have graduated from Tsinghua with highest honors and received my Bachelor of Science degree. I will always love Tsinghua. See [here](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/2275/85312.htm) and [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RCVecW4GX7rTNG6och--MQ) for media coverages (in Chinese) of my story at Tsinghua.
